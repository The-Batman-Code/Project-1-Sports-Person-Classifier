# Project-2-Sports-Person-Classifier

# Introduction -
In this data science project I walked through the process of building a Sports Person Classifier website. I first built a model using sklearn and logistic regression using images of multiple celebrities. Second step was to create a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component was the website built using html, css and javascript that allows user to upload images and it calls the python flask server to retrieve the result. During model building I covered many data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, etc. I enjoyed creating this project and I hope you like itðŸ˜Š
