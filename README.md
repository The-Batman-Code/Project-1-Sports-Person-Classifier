# Project-2-Sports-Person-Classifier
![](project_image.png)

# Introduction -
In this data science project I walked through the process of building a Sports Person Classifier website. I first built a model using sklearn and logistic regression using images of multiple celebrities. Second step was to create a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component was the website built using html, css and javascript that allows user to upload images and it calls the python flask server to retrieve the result. During model building I covered many data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, etc. I enjoyed creating this project and I hope you like itüòä

# Tools used to create the project-
1. Python
2. OpenCV for working with images
3. Numpy and pandas for data cleaning
4. Matplotlib for data visualization
5. Sklearn for model building
6. Jupyter Notebook in Visual Studio Code as IDE
7. Python flask server for http server
8. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI

# Deploy this app to cloud (GCP VM)-

1. Create VM instance using google cloud console and allow HTTP/HTTPS incoming traffic while setting the VM.
2. Generate SSH keys using PuTTYgen, save the private key with you and upload the key under the SSH Keys section in the settings of the VM.
3. Become the root user to avoid permission errors with the command-
```
sudo su
```
4. Navigate to the following location /home and set 777 permission for the ubuntu folder-
``` 
chmod 777 ubuntu/
```
5. Update the ubuntu instance and install nginx using using the commands-
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
6.  We can check whether the nginx server is running by loading the url of the instance in the browser.
7. Now login to your instance and transfer the application folder into /home/ubuntu/ (download this repo, extract it and rename the folder as SportsPersonClassifier, this folder is now your application folderüòä) in the VM instance using WinSCP application.
8. Install python using the command-
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
9. Install the required python libraries using the following commands one by one-
```
sudo pip3 install Flask
sudo pip3 install opencv-python
sudo pip3 install scikit-learn
sudo pip3 install Pywavelets
```
10. Install libgl1 as it is a dependency of opencv-
```
sudo apt-get install libgl1
```
11. Navigate to the location /etc/nginx. Change the configuration of the nginx.conf file to support the upload of large sized images-
```
user www-data;
worker_processes auto;
pid /run/nginx.pid;
include /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/*.conf;

events {
        worker_connections 768;
        # multi_accept on;
}

        ##
        # Gzip Settings
        ##

        gzip on;

        # gzip_vary on;
        # gzip_proxied any;
        # gzip_comp_level 6;

```
python3 SportsPersonClassifier/server/artifacts/server.py
```
22. To exit the tmux window press Ctrl + B and then D.
23. Reload the instance link in the browser and see the magic‚ù§Ô∏è. Have fun with it üòá Congratulationsüòçüòä.
